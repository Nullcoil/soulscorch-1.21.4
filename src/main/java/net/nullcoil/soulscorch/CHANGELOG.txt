V1.1.0

|----ENTITIES----|
 - Added the Soulborne Cat. When you take two cats to the Soul Sand Valley, breed them, you get a Soulborne Cat.
   When a tamed Soulborne Cat is following you, you gain the Cat Buff Status Effect, which clears you from the
   Soulscorch effect, and Restless and Soulless will not aggro (if not already aggroed).

|----BUG FIXES----|
 - Fixed Soulless head tracking. It's a lot creepier than I imagined it would turn out.

|----OTHER FEATURES----|
 - Soulless have acquired a lack of object permanence. Getting out of the line of sight of a Soulless in the Watching
   State will put them back to sleep. In the hostile state, they will remain aggroed for 1 minute (1200 game ticks),
   which will refresh if it gets an attack in.
