V1.0.0

|----BLOCKS----|
 - Added Soul Brewing Stand. Brews potions twice as fast, and uses Blazt Powder as fuel. Crafted with 1 Blazt Rod
   and 3 Basalt.
 - Added Iron Bulb. Basically a Copper Bulb, but only has one state and has a 1 tick delay before turning on and off.
   Same recipe shape as Copper Bulb, but with Iron Blocks (instead of copper) and a Blazt Rod (instead of a Blaze Rod).
 - Added a soul variant to Magma Blocks, called Soul Slag. It deals double damage and applies Soulscorch. Crafted with
   4 Soul Cream.
 - Iron Bulb and Copper Bulb recipes are rotatable.
 - Piglins are scared of these blocks.

 - - When affected by Soulscorch, every instance of damage decreases your max health by 1 (half a heart)
 - - This can be reversed by sleeping in the Overworld.
 - Added Soul Render Effect.
 - - Instantly increases your maximum health back to 20.

|----ENTITIES----|
 - Added the Blazt, which shoots Soul Charges that burst into clouds that deal Instant Damage and
   apply the Soulscorch Effect. Spawns in the Soul Sand Valley.
 - Added the Soulless. Breaking any soul-based block near a Soulless will wake it up to watch you. That's your first
   and only warning. Spawns in the Soul Sand Valley. Listen for their whispers when stagnant. Piglins are scared of
   Soulless.
 - Added the Restless. Any instance of damage will agitate the Restless, leading up to it charging once before going
